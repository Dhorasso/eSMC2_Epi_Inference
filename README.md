# eSMC²: Ensemble SMC² for Epidemiological Models

This repository contains the implementation of the **Ensemble SMC² (eSMC²)** algorithm for Bayesian inference in state-space epidemiological models, as described in our paper:

"Accelerated Bayesian inference for state-space epidemiological models with Ensemble SMC²"

---

## Features
- Joint inference of hidden states and epidemiological parameters.
- Ensemble-based approximation (EnKF) for scalable likelihood evaluation.
- Supports discrete, count-based epidemic data.
- Demonstrated on synthetic datasets and 2022 U.S. monkeypox incidence data.
